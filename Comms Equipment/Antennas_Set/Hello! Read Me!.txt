- Antennas set -

Models are created with 3Ds Max 2016 and Vray 3.2. Simple Lowpoly models that will enrich your exterior renders.

Scene does not include any backgrounds or other objects used in preview images apart from antennas themselves.

Models are polygonal (quads and tris), size units - cm.

There are three different meshes in the scene. For easy use objects are named logically (using English language and numbers).

Models are set in world coordinates x0 y0 z0.

No special plugin needed to open scene.

All .zip files contain textures (diffuse, bump, reflection, specular maps .png 2048x2048). Model is UV mapped and unwrapped (non overlaping). All zip files contain raw UV maps
 in case You would like to make Your own custom textures for the object.

All .zip files contain .mat file for all three antennas in the scene.

The polygon number is for all three meshes in total.

File Formats:
.MAX 2016
.FBX  
.OBJ  
.3DS  

Warning: Depending on which software package you are using, the exchange formats (.fbx, .obj, .3ds) may not match the preview images exactly. 
Due to the nature of these formats, there may be some textures that have to be loaded by hand and possibly triangulated geometry.
